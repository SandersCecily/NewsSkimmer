# NewsSkimmer

## Intro
This app is a scraper to visit a Google page about Google related news then scrapes that page for the top search results and presents them for the user to read. This project ended up working locally mostly; read the improvements to understand where it didn't.

## Technology Used
* Axios
* Express
* Cheerio
* Mongoose
* Path
* mLab
* Heroku
* Handlebars

## Improvements
During working on this project I broke the modal. If I wanted general improvements besides the functional fix I could add more styles like I had planned to or also edit the cards to show the pictures that I also scraped and did nothing with.
